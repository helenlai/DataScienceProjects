### Abstract 
The current questionnaire study aims to 1) explore organisational structure of ERQ, DERS, TAS,
UPPS-Negative Urgency and Belief about Emotion Controllability; 2) examine its utility in
predicting the diagnosis of ED and its subtypes; 3) investigate whether this model equally
explains the ED-related symptom severity among ED, its subtypes and community sample. A
total of 650 completed responses was recorded (Female: N=449; Male: N=144; Prefer Not to
say: N=52; Other: N=5). The age of the participants ranges from 16 to 73 (M=23.32, SD=8.58).
It was found that DERS (except for the Awareness-subscale), TAS and UPPS measure are
underlay by the same ER component, whereas ERQâ€™s adaptive and maladaptive dimensions, and
Belief about Emotional Controllability measured three unique ER component. The four extracted
components: Emotion Dysregulation, Inattention to Emotional Experience, Non-use of Adaptive
ER strategies and Implicit Belief about Emotion Malleability accounted for 76.43% of the total
variance. The dysregulation and belief component both predicted the diagnosis of ED and
symptom severity among the community sample, independent of depression and anxiety,
highlighting their needs for prioritised clinical focus. The dysregulation component also
discriminated ED subtypes. However, such an effect disappeared when depression is controlled.
Although the findings are largely consistent with the trans-diagnostic perspective, further
research that focuses on the emotion dysregulation and depression is necessary prior to
concluding on the need for differentiated treatments among subtypes
