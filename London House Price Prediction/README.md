Key stages:
- Data wangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data sourcing with Foursquare API
- Data Preparation for Machine Learning
- Feature selection with Random Forest (feature importance measure)
- Tune and cross-validate Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine
- Model comparison on the testing set
